        <h2><a href="">My first blog post</a></h2>
        <p>Why, why here!
            I have no idea why I suddenly wanted to start a blog. Earlier before, when I had the thought of publishing my thoughts and silly writings somewhere where people can see, some sort of devil inside told me this, "Dear boy, nobody cares what you think, nobody in this sick world really listens and understands what people has got to say". Well,  even though I can't get rid of that thought completely in the first place, I have decided to give it a try. I am trying hard to get out of the silly 'Hell with the people and this society' club or 'i-wanna-quit-my-job-and-travel' team. Truth is, I was there for a lot of time. Maybe because a lot of changes has happened when it comes to my beliefs and ideas.
            
            Yes, when to comes to my beliefs and ideas, only some factors have influenced or molded my thinking. Cinema, books, people and travel. But when it comes to books and travel, I admit that I am still a beginner. I have read very little books and travelled very little places. The interesting people i have met and some of the brilliant movies  that I saw had done a lot of difference to my world view, thinking, politics and beliefs. And if I have not imbibed from from all these factors, the fault is entirely mine. I wish that I will meet further interesting people and travel many places which might influence my character and life.
            
            There is something that i have read long back from a book i can't remember but which had caught my attention for a long time. "I believe that man, still in an intermediate stage between animal and the divine, can raise himself into a higher plane of being if he makes a conscious and dedicated effort to do so, and that there can be no nobler endeavor than this aspiration towards divinity. I believe that each human being born on this planet, or for that matter anywhere in the limitless cosmos, carries within himself an unquenchable spark of divinity, and that our true destiny as human beings revolve around the fanning of this spark into the smokeless flame of spiritual realization. Also, I believe that all of our activities ( social, political, economical) should have its ultimate goal as fostering this divinity within each individual. I believe that at their highest, all religions are so many different paths leading to the same goal, the ultimate union between human and divine.And all the strife and hatred in the name of religion in therefore the very antithesis of spirituality and a gross slur on the name of humanity".
            One of the prayers in India that makes a lot of sense to me, is the 'three pavamana mantras' which says "from the unreal lead me to the real; from darkness lead me to the light; from death lead me to immortality." All these, inspired from that unknown mystery writer who had kept me thinking for a very long time.
            
            I have gone too far. This is not why i started blogging. Not philosophy, not life lessons,nothing.  Basically i would love to write reviews here.Music, cinema, literature, sports, maybe politics. Anything.  On anything that will inspire me, makes me think, makes me emotional, makes me compassionate, makes an effort in instrumenting human transformation and can thus contribute substantially to the broader goals that lie before the human race.
            
            Peace</p>

        <h2><a href="">Kodachadri</a></h2>
        <p>Kodachadri
            This is a story that i cannot stop saying.
            We reached Mookambika Temple(Kollur,Karnataka) by 9 am today hoping to catch a jeep to reach Kodachadri, a mountain peak inside a dense forest know as a spiritual destination and a favourite spot of travellers. A very large portion of devotees reaching Mookambika are from Kerala and we were surprised to find hotels with boards in malayalam and local people talking good malayalam. It was only at this place after one week in Karnataka we could not talk out loud in malayalam whatever we felt like because it really felt like home and we had to be careful with our words! 'We' is just me and my friend Dan who felt like going on a journey with not much people in the group and something different from all the trips we had made till now! 
            It's about a one and half hours journey in a jeep to Kodachadri. We found a jeep that ll take us there and when we were about to leave, a family including an old lady came to us and asked if they could join our group. The jeep driver, seeing the old lady told them that the path is really dangerous, we have to hold strongly to the iron rods in the jeep to prevent us from falling off the jeep and it's highly improbable that she can make this journey easily. As this was an entirely new route for us, we kept quiet not knowing the situation. They left us telling its okay then and they cant come without their mother. We could see that terrible sadness in the old grandmas eyes. So, the four of us, including two other total strangers, decided not to waste any more time and start our journey. The first one hour was quite peaceful and through some villages but with wonderful roads. It was after we crossed the forest check post we realised that we were into something big. The path the jeep crossed in that last half an hour was unbelievably terrifying. Crossing the big rocks, mud and the breathtaking curves, I once tried releasing my one hand from the rod to take a picture and ended up hitting my head on top of the jeep! Such difficult was it to sit inside the jeep. I remember, me and Dan saying throughout that journey that it was a good thing that we didnt take the granny along and she could have never made this path. 
            WE reached the point till the jeep goes after a murderous journey (WE believe that one reason it became too horrible was our driver, who was too audacious and reckless!) and there was still a 1.5km trek to the top point where Sarvajna peetha is situated, where it is believed that Adi Shankara has meditated. THAT was another physically challenging trek in spite of the fog and chill it gave us! Somehow, four of us, finishing off the two bottles of water with us, tired and sweating reached the peak. The view from there was so brilliant that we decided to rest for some time there. What we saw after some time, must be one of the moments in my life I can never forget. 
            The same old woman whom we denied our jeep for looking old, whom we kept mentioning throughout that it was a good thing not letting her come, the lady who look old enough to be my great grandmother, the same lady for whom nobody in this world would bet she could have made it to this point, She was climbing up the hills easily and was about to reach us!! I just couldn't believe it was her until she got close to us even after other members in my group were convinced. Rajesh, a rickshaw man from Mangalore in our group couldn't stop his excitement and kept saying, "this is a miracle, this is a miracle"  and never tried to stop tears coming from his eyes. The other guy who is also a Rajesh, an engineer in Dubai (Who is also an alumni of my college) was also trying to keep his calm. He literally fell at her feet and told her to forgive him for the ignorance we have shown. That was when She told us her age, she was in her sweet 80's and that she'll pray for us all. Me and Dan were unable to get a word out of our tongue and were standing in awe for some time! 
            She started to go to the temple telling us goodbye, without even resting for some time.
            I Didn't speak to Dan or anyone in the group for some time climbing down the hill as I was confused and filled with so much emotions like never before in my life. I cried, literally cried, I never tried to stop tears, I knew what I saw was teaching me one of the greatest lessons in life, I knew moments like this happen rarely in your life, I knew that everyone else in our group was going through the same emotions, I decided to be silent.
            A simple answer to what might have helped the grandmother to climb the hills must be 'faith'. Yes, maybe. Faith can work miracles. 
            I like to believe that it's not just another 'miracle of faith'. I believe that its just another simple lesson she taught us, that one we already knew and ignored it for being so simple, "Believing in yourselves".</p>
